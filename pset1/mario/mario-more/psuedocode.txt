I have to create a ascending pyramid and then mirror that so it should be decending 

The ascending one I created 

We can create two funtctions One called ascending and another called decending. 

In the main the ascending and decending should only print if the input is the same and it should be seperated by a space

<--------------NEW SOLUTION-------------->
Another alternative is to create a loop and print spaces between the staircase the space should be equal. 

Try to locate the variable that will be best for the loop.
